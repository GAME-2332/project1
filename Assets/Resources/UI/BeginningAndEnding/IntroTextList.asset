  - One day, you decided to scope out an abandoned mall for your Me-Tube page.
  - 'As an urban explorer, it is in your job description to explore the places that
    was once touched by society and are now left to rot. '
  - 'With a very hardy push... you manage to make your way through the old mall entrance. '
  - 'But in the same effort, you also failed to see the visible hole in the floor... '
  - ... plunging you down below.
